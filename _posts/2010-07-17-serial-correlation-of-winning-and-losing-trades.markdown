I came across a comment on something the Turtle traders had done, which was to stay out of the market in the next trading period following a 2x size win or loss.   Interesting idea.   They must have made the following observations for their strategy:



	
  1. unusually large winning trades were followed by losing trades (negative serial correlation or mean reversion for big winners)

	
  2. unusually large losing trades were often followed by another losing trade (positive serial correlation for large losing trades)


My main strategy is multi-asset so probably doesn't lend itself as well to a "rule" like this.   Interesting thought though.   I should do some analysis on the pattern of winners and losers and see whether there is a consistent pattern.

Certainly for a single asset, it is not unusual to see mean-reversion following a ramp up in price.
