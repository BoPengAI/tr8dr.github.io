MACD seems to be an effective measure when paired with other analysis. Â  We need to look at:



	
  1. **derivative of the lightly smoothed MACD**
Crossings precede inflections generally

	
  2. **Momentum largely over with inflection in MACD
Slowed momentum indicates high chance of following inflection in price series. **

	
  3. **observe slope of MACD to determine whether momentum is over**
When MACD inflects should exit position as momentum lost

	
  4. **use volatility to scale time, removing ewma issues**
Duration RV seems OK, but expectation based may work better.

	
  5. **scaling MACD timing based on volatility
Alternatively we may want to descale the time axis, and normalize all assets to some vol level. **


**Here are some variables**:



	
  1. MACD level (smoothed)

	
  2. dMACD

	
  3. prior / current MACD inflection +,-

	
  4. amplitude from prior non-trivial inflection

	
  5. prior window slope

	
  6. current window slope

	
  7. volatility

	
  8. S&P direction

**Uses Random Trees**



	
  1. Determine trade training set, values between -1, 0, 1

	
  2. Determine relevant variables with random trees

	
  3. Attempt to use random trees to predict portfolio
