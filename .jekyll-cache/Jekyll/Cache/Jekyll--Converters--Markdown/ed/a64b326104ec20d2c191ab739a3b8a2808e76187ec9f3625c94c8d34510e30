I"<<p>A friend of mine (thanks Adal) suggested that I look at other stable coins, again observing the relationship between 
coin issuance and momentum.  Given that Circle (USDC) and Binance coin (BUSD) are widely traded, focused on these
two coins.</p>

<p>Binance coin is newer than Circle, so I only have history for BUSD from late 2019.  However, will compare the signal
from these coins for events in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="2020-covid-bounce">2020 Covid Bounce</h2>
<p>Here is the combined signal for USDC and BUSD during the covid bounce (this looks like a better read than USDT):</p>

<p>USDC and BUSD accumulation is in advance of Q4 momentum:</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Analyzing issuance of stable coin gives us a view on buying interest.  A good signal would blend information from
both of these coins (perhaps looking at the cross-correlation of excitation).</p>
