These are my musings about strategies, statistics, computer science, numerical techniques, etc.    I am a quant / developer, living in the New York area.

I arrived here via a twisted road.    Given my area of study in
university, parallel algorithms and applied math, I never had any intention of joining Wall
Street.   I got involved with Lehman Brothers in the 90s as they had a research group exploring Neural Nets, VR, Parallel Processing, and Voice Recognition. 

We developed approaches for the parallel evaluation of financial models such as:  a prepayment model for CMOs and later HJM for exotic path dependent interest rate models.   Gradually was pulled into the business.   I went to Tokyo in 1994 with Lehman and was thrown in the deep end of the pool to learn the IR derivatives business.

The problems were interesting and the software use on wall street was still nascent / bleading-edge.   Things changed gradually, I tired of it, and left the street to pursue other interests â€” for a while.

The idea of systematic trading always appealed to me, though seemed
far away from reality in the early 90s for many asset classes.   I had
the opportunity to do this with a firm in the early 2000s.   I love
that algo trading requires one to be somewhat of a polymath,
pulling together the mathematics, computer science, market knowledge,
and creativity into one package.   Thus it has been my focus for the last 15 years.
