I'd like to point to a very interesting set of lectures by Scott Aaronson entitled "**Quantum Computing Since Democritus", **[here](http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/)**. ** The lectures have a lot of thought provoking content in addition to being entertaining -- a style reminiscent of Richard Feynman.
