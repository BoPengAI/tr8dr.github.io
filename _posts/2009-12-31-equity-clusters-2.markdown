The correlations between daily returns show, sometimes, surprising relationships.  Looking at relationships on 5-day cumulative returns produced clusters more in line with the traditional view.

This is not surprising as weekly returns will have less "noise" than daily.    A more robust measure than correlation needs to be used to determine whether relationships seen on daily or higher-frequency are bona fide.
