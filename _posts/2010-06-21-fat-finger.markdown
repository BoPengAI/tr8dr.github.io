I've been doing some manual trades now and then.  Was at the gym this morning and thought to buy an equity.

Dumb thing to do:  Sent in the request from my iphone, accidentally multiplying the amount by 10x.   I ended up long with a 600K$ position that did not want.   For whatever reason could not manage to put in the sell from the phone and was getting worried that I could not properly monitor the appropriate exit.    Had to leave mid-exercise and handle.

Luckily  exited with a few thousand in profit, but could have gone the other way.
