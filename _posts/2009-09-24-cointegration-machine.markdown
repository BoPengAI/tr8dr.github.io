I've done some interesting cointegration work for canadian securities and see some likely basket / spread trades.

I was thinking about the equity and FX markets and the vast number of total securities one might investigate.   We can test for stable cointegration and mean-reversion style trading in a systematic manner.    Why not create a "machine" to test the many combinations for viable trading strategies.

Of course we will need market data for a large number of securities to pull this off ...
