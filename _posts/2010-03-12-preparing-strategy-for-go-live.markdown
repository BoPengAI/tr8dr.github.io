I've been too busy to post for the last few weeks because am trying to get things together to launch the first strategy for trading (as part of my trading startup).    Have 4 strategies right now but decided to start with the simplest of the lot.   It operates on a basket of equities at medium/low frequency and has excellent returns and drawdown profile.

I won't jinx it by indicating the performance profile (which is pretty exciting).   Will post some results after it has a trading track record.   Right now have just done the backtesting and some trial trading (affected manually).

The next steps are negotiating commission with broker(s) and connectivity.   Details at this point, but will take time.
